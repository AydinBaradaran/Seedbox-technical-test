Note: The explanation and results are shown in more detail in the .pynb file in this repo, as well the .py file is written as a production file to send any new data set to it to answer these questions "easyly" provided the csv files provided format of how the data looks remains the same.

The statistical tests are only included in the .pynb file as it is more manageable to display the process and results from start to finish, the .py files' aim was to answer the question and show the results (.pynb is to show the results in depth)
